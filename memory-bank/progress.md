# Progress

## What Works

- Project setup with SwiftUI and Swift Data
- Initial architecture decisions documented
- Basic UI components created
- Development environment configured

## What's Left to Build

### Phase 1 (Launch)

- [ ] **Implement Core Tracking Engine**
  - Implement Swift Data models for Habit and Completion as per schema
  - Set up local Swift Data persistence and ensure schema matches documentation
  - Prepare codebase for phased CloudKit sync (UUIDs, relationships, abstraction)
- [ ] **Build GitHub-Style Visualization**
  - Implement GitHub-style visualization grid for habits
  - Build Home Screen as the central hub with ongoing habits and recent completions
- [ ] **Satisfying Habit Completion**
  - Build HapticManager utility for progressive and satisfying haptic feedback
  - Implement long-press completion interaction with visual and haptic feedback
- [ ] **Basic Widgets**
  - Create medium and large widgets for single-habit visualization
  - Add App Group for widget data sharing
  - Implement widget configuration and deep linking to habit detail
  - Optimize widget grid rendering for performance
- [ ] **Visual Onboarding**
  - Design and implement interactive onboarding tutorial
- [ ] **Navigation & UI**
  - Set up NavigationStack and .navigationDestination() for drill-down navigation
  - Use .sheet() for modal creation and editing flows
  - Implement custom transitions for fluid navigation
  - Add settings screen accessible from navigation bar
- [ ] **Accessibility**
  - Add VoiceOver support and test all screens for accessibility
  - Ensure Dynamic Type and color contrast are supported everywhere
  - Use accessibility modifiers and include accessibility in "done" criteria
- [ ] **Error Handling & Testing**
  - Implement user-friendly error messages and contextual error presentation
  - Add error prevention in UI (input validation, auto-save, affordances)
  - Add recovery strategies (retry, offline, crash data preservation)
  - Use Swift's Result type for error handling
  - Write unit and UI tests for all critical flows (habit creation, completion, error handling, widgets)
  - Add accessibility tests (VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, color contrast)
  - Integrate tests into CI pipeline and ensure all tests pass before merging
- [ ] **Documentation & Code Quality**
  - Enforce SwiftLint and SwiftFormat for code style
  - Require doc comments for all public APIs and complex logic
  - Keep README and technical documentation up to date
  - Require code review for all merges and document architectural changes

### Phase 2 (Post-Launch)

- [ ] **Advanced Widgets**
  - Expand widget options and customization (e.g., show all habits, different timeframes)
- [ ] **Progress Cards**
  - Implement exportable/shareable progress cards for milestones and streaks
- [ ] **Data Export/Import**
  - Add CSV/JSON export options for user data ownership
  - Implement basic CSV import for migration from other apps

### Phase 3 (Future Roadmap)

- [ ] **Accountability Partners**
  - Implement privacy-focused sharing capabilities for accountability partners
- [ ] **Additional Visualization Options**
  - Explore and implement new visualization types beyond the GitHub grid

## Current Status

We are in the early stages of Phase 1 development, focusing on implementing the core tracking engine and GitHub-style visualization. The project structure has been set up, and we are now working on implementing the basic functionality.

## Known Issues

- None yet - project is in initial development
