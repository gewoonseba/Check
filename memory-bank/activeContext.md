# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

We are currently in the initial development phase (Phase 1) of the Check app, focusing on implementing the core functionality:

1. **Core Tracking Engine**: Implementing Swift Data models and persistence
2. **GitHub-Style Visualization**: Building the central visualization component
3. **Satisfying Habit Completion**: Implementing the long-press interaction with haptic feedback
4. **Basic Widgets**: Creating the initial widget suite

## Recent Changes

- Project structure has been set up with SwiftUI and Swift Data
- Initial data models have been defined
- Basic UI components have been created
- Architecture decisions have been documented

## Next Steps

1. Complete the Core Tracking Engine implementation
   - Finalize Swift Data models for Habit and Completion
   - Set up local persistence
   - Implement basic CRUD operations

2. Build the GitHub-style visualization grid
   - Create the grid component
   - Implement date-based coloring
   - Add interaction for viewing/editing specific dates

3. Implement the satisfying habit completion interaction
   - Build the HapticManager utility
   - Create the long-press gesture with visual feedback
   - Add haptic feedback patterns

4. Begin work on basic widgets
   - Set up App Group for data sharing
   - Create medium and large widget templates
   - Implement widget configuration

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Current Decisions Being Made

1. **Visualization Grid Implementation**
   - Considering whether to use LazyVGrid or custom layout for the GitHub-style grid
   - Evaluating performance implications of different approaches
   - Testing different visual styles for the grid cells

2. **Habit Frequency Options**
   - Determining the exact options for weekly habits (specific days vs. any N days per week)
   - Considering how to handle monthly habits (specific date vs. any N days per month)
   - Evaluating the UI for selecting frequency options

3. **Widget Design**
   - Deciding on the final visual design for widgets
   - Determining the best way to show completion status in limited space
   - Planning the widget configuration options

### Open Questions

1. Should we implement streak tracking in the initial version or defer to Phase 2?
2. How should we handle time zones for users who travel frequently?
3. What's the best approach for the onboarding flow - guided tour or learn-by-doing?
4. Should we support Apple Watch in the initial release?
