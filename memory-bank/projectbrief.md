# Check: A Visualization-First Habit Tracker

## Summary

**Check** is an iOS app designed to help people build and maintain positive habits through the power of visual tracking. Unlike complex habit apps that overwhelm users with features, Check focuses on providing a beautiful, GitHub-style visualization that makes habit completion intrinsically motivating.

**Core Purpose:**
- Help users establish daily, weekly, and monthly habits through simple tracking
- Motivate through visual progress rather than complex gamification
- Make habit tracking feel satisfying and meaningful
- Provide easy access to tracking through widgets and intuitive interactions

**Key Differentiation:**
- The GitHub-style year visualization as the central, motivating feature
- A uniquely satisfying completion interaction with haptic feedback
- Simplicity without sacrificing completeness
- iOS-native experience with extensive widget support

**Philosophy:**
Check follows the SLC framework—Simple, Lovable, and Complete—focusing on doing a few things exceptionally well rather than many things adequately. We prioritize the emotional satisfaction of tracking habits over complex analytics, creating an experience that users look forward to engaging with daily.
